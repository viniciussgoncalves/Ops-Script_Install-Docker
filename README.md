# Docker Install Script

## Description

This script automates the installation of Docker on an Ubuntu system. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks if Docker is already installed. If installed, it prints the installed version and exits.
2. Updates the system packages.
3. Installs necessary dependencies.
4. Adds Docker's official GPG key.
5. Adds the Docker repository to the system's Apt sources.
6. Updates the package index again.
7. Installs Docker packages.
8. Enables and starts the Docker service.
9. Adds the current user to the Docker group to allow Docker commands without `sudo`.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu-based system.
- `sudo` privileges.

## Usage

1. **Download and run the script:**

   ```sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viniciussgoncalves/Ops-Script_Install_Docker/main/docker_install.sh && bash docker_install.sh
   ```

   The script will check if Docker is already installed. If it is, the script will print the installed version and exit. If not, it will proceed with the installation.

## Script Details

### print_header

### check_docker_installed
